// ==================== FADE-IN PARAGRAPHS ANIMATION COMPONENT ====================
/**
 * FadeInParagraphs.js - Advanced sequential text animation with user controls
 * 
 * This sophisticated animation component creates engaging narrative experiences
 * through timed, sequential text reveals. It provides smooth fade-in animations
 * with vertical translation effects, user skip functionality, and flexible
 * timing controls for optimal storytelling pacing.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - **Sequential Animation**: Paragraphs appear one by one with configurable timing
 * - **Smooth Transitions**: Combined opacity and transform animations
 * - **User Skip Control**: Click-to-skip functionality for impatient users
 * - **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable animation duration and delays
 * - **Warning Text Support**: Special handling for concluding warning messages
 * - **Progress Indication**: Visual cues for skip availability
 * 
 * Animation Techniques:
 * - **Opacity Transitions**: Smooth fade-in from transparent to opaque
 * - **Vertical Translation**: Subtle upward movement (translateY) for dynamic feel
 * - **Eased Timing**: Different easing functions for opacity vs transform
 * - **State-Driven Styling**: CSS properties controlled by React state
 * 
 * User Experience Design:
 * - **Immediate Start**: First paragraph appears instantly to avoid delay
 * - **Comfortable Pacing**: Default 600ms delays provide good reading rhythm
 * - **Skip Accessibility**: Large click area and clear skip indication
 * - **Visual Feedback**: Cursor pointer indicates interactive area

 * @param {number} fadeDuration - Duration of fade-in animation in milliseconds (default: 800)

 * @param {string} warningText - Optional warning text to display after all paragraphs

  // ==================== ANIMATION STATE MANAGEMENT ====================
  /**
   * Sophisticated state system for controlling sequential animation progression
   * 
   * This state management system orchestrates the complex timing and progression
   * of the sequential animation, tracking both the current animation state and
   * user interaction override capabilities.
   */
  
  // ========== TOTAL CONTENT CALCULATION ==========
  /**
   * Dynamic calculation of total content items to animate
   * 
   * Calculates the total number of items (paragraphs + optional warning text)
   * that need to be animated, providing the endpoint for the animation sequence.
   * 
   * Calculation Logic:
   * - **Base Count**: paragraphs.length provides the main content count
   * - **Warning Addition**: Adds 1 if warningText exists
   * - **Dynamic Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts to content changes
   * - **Animation Endpoint**: Defines when animation sequence is complete
   */
  const totalParagraphs = paragraphs.length + (warningText ? 1 : 0);
  
  // ========== ANIMATION PROGRESSION STATE ==========
  /**
   * Core animation state variables for controlling reveal progression
   * 
   * These state variables work together to manage the sophisticated timing
   * and user interaction capabilities of the animation system.

  // ==================== SEQUENTIAL ANIMATION EFFECT ====================
  /**
   * Master animation controller with intelligent timing and skip handling
   * 
   * This effect orchestrates the entire animation sequence, managing both
   * automatic progression and user-initiated skipping. It implements
   * sophisticated timing logic to create engaging narrative pacing.
   * 
   * Animation Phases:
   * 1. **Immediate Start**: First paragraph appears instantly (no delay)
   * 2. **Sequential Progression**: Subsequent paragraphs appear with delays
   * 3. **Completion Detection**: Stops when all content is visible
   * 4. **Skip Override**: User interaction can bypass timing
   * 
   * Technical Features:
   * - **Zero-Delay Start**: Immediate first paragraph prevents perceived lag
   * - **Timer Management**: Proper setTimeout cleanup prevents memory leaks
   * - **Skip Integration**: skipped flag immediately stops automatic progression
   * - **State Synchronization**: visibleCount drives all animation states
   * 
   * Timing Logic:
   * - **First Paragraph**: Appears immediately (visibleCount 0 â†’ 1)
   * - **Subsequent Paragraphs**: Use paragraphDelay for pacing
   * - **Completion**: Stops when visibleCount reaches totalParagraphs
   * - **User Override**: Skip functionality bypasses all timers
   * 
   * Performance Considerations:
   * - **Efficient Cleanup**: Timer cleanup prevents memory leaks
   * - **Conditional Execution**: Only runs when animation should progress
   * - **State Minimization**: Minimal state updates for smooth performance
   * - **Early Returns**: Efficient logic flow with appropriate early exits

   * Instant animation skip handler for user convenience
   * 
   * This function provides immediate animation completion when users want
   * to skip the timed sequence and see all content instantly. It demonstrates
   * excellent user experience design by respecting user agency.
   * 
   * Skip Features:
   * - **Immediate Completion**: Sets visibleCount to maximum instantly
   * - **Skip Flag**: Sets skipped flag to prevent further automatic progression
   * - **User Agency**: Respects user preference for faster content consumption
   * - **State Synchronization**: Ensures all content becomes visible immediately
   * 
   * UX Benefits:
   * - **Accessibility**: Accommodates users with different reading preferences
   * - **Efficiency**: Allows quick content consumption for returning users
   * - **Control**: Gives users control over their experience pacing
   * - **Responsiveness**: Immediate response to user interaction
